On the right is a screenshot of a website at three different screen
sizes
    - less than 600px wide
    - between 600
    - 900px wide
    - and larger than 900px wide

The starter code has all the HTML for the page
but a lot of the CSS is missing.

Your job is to complete the CSS to match the styles below.
You will need min media queries at 600px and 900px
